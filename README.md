# Test_R
Just getting used to R on github. Here's a repository of my R based conceptual site modeling tools. a few are complete, some are under construction.
the data source for all this R work is in the Datasource.xls 
Note most of this is a work in progress, the ones that are closer to finalization have good comments, the others have mostly working comments that sometimes have a lot of enthusiasm or excitement or profanity or both.
