# Test_R
Just getting used to R on github. hopefully will create a repository of my R based conceptual site modeling tools
the data source for all this R work is in the Datasource.xls 
Note most of this is a work in progress, the ones that are closer to finalization have good comments, the others have mostly working comments that sometimes have a lot of enthusiasm or excitement or profanity or both.
