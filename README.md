Here's a repository of my R based conceptual site modeling tools. a few are complete, some are under construction.

"Conceptual site modeling" is a thing I would do as a water resources engineer. It is a process where you first look at geology, hydrology, and history of the site or study area, then choose which processes are most important for the goal of the project. 

A simple example is: There was a chemical leak at a manufacturing plant, there is contaminated groundwater, and it has been monitored for several years. Now we want to decide how to clean it up. We need tools to visualize all the historical chemical informaiton, to look for trends, compare with the geology. There are some R tools here to do that. 

The data source for all this R work is in the Datasource.xls, a common way of getting data in the environmental field was flat files (from EQUIS, or similar).
